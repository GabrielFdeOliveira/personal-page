            <p>
              After six years working in the automotive sector, I have decided
              to change careers, and pursue a dream I have had since my teenage,
              so after achieving my mortgage I decided it was time.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              {" "}
              I have a beautiful relationship with{" "}
              <span className="font-bold text-teal-500">{"feedback"}</span>, it
              is the tool I used to develop my English skills, and if it helped
              me with that I am sure it will continue to serve me well in the
              tech industry!
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I have a diverse range of hobbies and interests that keep me busy.
              Including activities like reading, gaming, working out, and
              exploring the countryside, as well as bird watching and coding. I
              am constantly on the lookout for new experiences and opportunities
              to learn and grow, and I find great joy in engaging myself in
              these activities.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>

                never stop growing
              </span>{" "}
              and that&#39;s what I strive to do, I have a passion for
              technology and a desire to always push the limits of what is
              possible. I am excited to see where my career takes me and am
              always open to new opportunities. ðŸ™‚
